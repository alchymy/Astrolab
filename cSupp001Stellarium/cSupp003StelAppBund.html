<h1>Application Bundles</h1>
<p>When you look at the contents of a disk in the Finder, almost every item you 
see corresponds to a single file. But sometimes, the Finder is not giving you 
the entire story.&nbsp; Mac OS X provides a way 
to collect related files into a single entity called a <em>bundle</em>, and OS X 
conspires with the Finder to present bundles as one icon.</p>
<p>Applications are the most prominent kinds of bundles, but they&#39;re far from 
the only bundles on your Mac. Bundles provide a handy general mechanism for 
keeping a load of stuff behind a single icon. Mac OS X uses 
bundles in various situations that require code to be kept together with 
images, property lists, and other flotsam. Screen savers, preference 
panes, Dashboard widgets, frameworks, and application plug-ins are all 
bundles, each one with some files that have code and others containing 
data.</p>
<p>A bundle is basically a folder that appears in the Finder as a single 
file. This convenient fiction allows users to easily install and move 
applications without having to worry about keeping their support files 
around, and it also prevents casual users from messing up their 
applications by trashing a necessary file.</p>
<p>Although Mac OS X uses bundles primarily as a way to hide collections 
of code plus other resources, no rule says that bundles must include 
pieces of code. A database developer might choose to store databases and 
indices together in a bundle, for example.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X Installer uses a bundle technology called 
<em>packages</em> to gather all the files needed for installing software 
into a unit, an installation package. The Installer then extracts the 
files it needs from the package and puts them where they belong.</p>
<h2>Looking at Bundles</h2>
<p>Bundles are folders in disguise, to see inside a bundle, 
you can simply use the Finder.</p>
<p>1. In the Finder, choose a bundle to inspect. You can pick any 
application, screen saver, preference pane, Dashboard widget, or other 
bundle you like. For this example, use the Spotlight preference pane. You 
can find it in /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Spotlight.prefPane.</p>
<p>2. Pull down the Action menu in the Finder window (the one with a 
picture of a gear) and choose Show Package Contents. This opens a new 
window with a Contents folder, as shown in Figure 11-1.<br />
<br />
</p>

        name="_x0000_i1025" /> 
<p>Figure 11-1: This folder is hidden inside bundles.</p></blockquote>
<p>3. Look inside the Contents folder to see all the other stuff hidden by 
the bundle (Figure 11-2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img id="_x0000_i1033" height="280" 
        src="../../AstrolabNB/cSupp001Stellarium/ImageLibStellarium/58345X-fg1102.jpg" width="400" 
        name="_x0000_i1033" /></p>
<p>Figure 11-2: The bundle's Contents folder contains files and 
subfolders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple is a little schizophrenic about the terms <em>bundle</em> and 
<em>package</em>. Although Apple's developer documentation defines a 
<em>bundle</em> as the fundamental mechanism behind applications, screen 
savers, and the like, note that the Finder's menu item uses the term 
<em>package</em> instead of <em>bundle</em>.</p>
<p>Mac OS X and the Finder collaborate on the bundle illusion to show you 
a single icon instead of the full bundle contents. But the command line 
isn't fooled. If you use Terminal, bundles appear like the folders they 
truly are.</p>
<p>To see how this works, go to a Terminal window and type the 
following:</p>
<p><code>ls 
/System/Library/PreferencePanes/Spotlight.prefPane/Contents/</code></p>
<p>That command results in this output:</p>
<p><code>Info.plist MacOS Resources version.plist</code></p>
<p class="GX">Those are exactly the same contents you saw in the Finder 
using the Show Package Contents command. So, you can examine what's inside 
a bundle using either the Finder or Terminal, whichever you prefer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Thanks for Showing Up</b></i></p>
<p><i>The Action menu provides a surefire way to tell if an icon is a 
bundle. If the Show Package Contents item is in the menu, the selected 
item is a bundle-if the item isn't a bundle, that item simply doesn't 
appear.</i></p>
<p><i>You don't have to use the Action menu to look inside a bundle. The 
Finder provides a contextual menu shortcut for Show Package Contents. 
Just Control-click (or right-click) on the bundle you want to explore, 
and Show Package Contents appears in the contextual 
menu.</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>A Tour of Bundle Contents</h2>
<p>When you open an application bundle, or most any other kind of bundle, 
you see a Contents folder at the first level inside. Let's take a look at 
what's inside the Contents folder.</p>
<p>In this example, you investigate the TextEdit application. You start by 
seeing (almost) everything there is to see.</p>
<p>1. In the Finder, go to the Applications folder and select 
TextEdit.</p>
<p>2. Choose Show Package Contents from the Action menu.</p>
<p>3. Click the List View button in the Finder window.</p>
<p>4. Click the triangle next to the Contents folder to see what's inside. 
The result should look like Figure 11-3. The Contents folder has five 
items: Info.plist, MacOS folder, PkgInfo, Resources folder, and 
version.plist. I talk about these in more detail later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img id="_x0000_i1026" height="201" 
        src="../../AstrolabNB/cSupp001Stellarium/ImageLibStellarium/58345X-fg1103.jpg" width="400" 
        name="_x0000_i1026" /></p>
<p>Figure 11-3: Finder shows what's in the Contents 
folder.</p></blockquote>
<p>5. Click the triangle next to MacOS to see what it contains. There 
should be a single object, a file named TextEdit. This is a file 
containing the executable code for TextEdit. When you double-click the 
TextEdit icon to launch it, Mac OS X runs the code in this file.</p>
<p>6. Click the triangle to open the Resources folder. There's a lot of 
stuff in there! You see a bunch of folders with the names of various 
languages (English.lproj, Dutch.lproj, and so on), some files with 
recognizable file types (Edit.icns contains icons and DocumentWindow.nib 
comes from the Interface Builder development tool), and a few others 
(Figure 11-4).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img id="_x0000_i1027" height="299" 
        src="../../AstrolabNB/cSupp001Stellarium/ImageLibStellarium/58345X-fg1104.jpg" width="400" 
        name="_x0000_i1027" /></p>
<p>Figure 11-4: The Resources folder in TextEdit bundle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that you have an idea of all the files that are hanging around 
inside application bundles, I discuss what all that stuff is for.</p>

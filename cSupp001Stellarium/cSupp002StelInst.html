</H1>

<p align="justify">  Installing the Intel version of Stellarium involved downloading the disc image 
  file from the Stellarium site and then simply copying the application package to 
  the iMac Applications folder. No installer process had to be run and it is best 
  to copy the application out of the disc image file.&nbsp; An alias can then be 
created to place on your Desktop.</p>
<p align="justify">The main application comes as a package file which 
  effectively hides the contents inside a folder with its own directory structure.&nbsp; The first time the 
  Stellarium application is run it creates a folder in the OS X user library, this 
  has its own directory structure and a folder is created under each user who runs 
  Stellarium on the machine.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">This User Data Directory is used to store the configuration 
  file for that user, scripts and data, all of which override configuration and 
  data in the main application folder. The main application contents thus act as a 
  default for new users and a backup should anything go wrong with a users 
  configuration.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">If a file exists in the <em>User Data Directory</em>, it will be used in 
  preference to a file with the same name existing in the <em>Installation Data 
    Directory</em>. This allows users to customise data files, textures and so on 
  without modifying the originally installed files.</p>
<p align="justify">The details of the main application and its &#39;bundle&#39; 
  structure and the user directory are now detailed in the sections that follow.</p>

<LI>Locate the <TT>stellarium-0.9.1.dmg</TT> file in finder and double
click on it, or open it using the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">disk copy</SPAN> program.</LI>
<LI>Have a browse of the <TT>readme</TT> file, and drag <TT>Stellarium</TT>
to the <TT>Applications</TT> folder (or somewhere else if you prefer).</LI>
<LI>Note that it is better to copy Stellarium out of the .dmg file to
run it - some users have reported problems when running directly from
the .dmg file.

  No installer process had to be run and it is best 
  to copy the application out of the disc image file, a double click on the &quot;dmg&quot; file opens up a simple drag and drop to the Applications folder.</LI>

<p align="justify"> By selecting and &quot;right click&quot; an alias can then be 
  created in the Applications folder to drag to the Desktop, or place in a specific folder with other Astronomy related applications.&nbsp; Example below shows how to group applications without cluttering the Desktop or Dock :</p>

<p align="justify">There is also a Universal binary version 
  of Stellarium available which will work for older Gn series Mac platforms, but the Intel 
  specific version is recommended for the Intel platform.&nbsp; ( Our Alchymy Lab 
  currently has Intel iMac and G4 Power Book platforms, but our main use is the 
  iMac platform ).</p>

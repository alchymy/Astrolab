EXTRA TEXTURES
--------------------------------------

This collection of extra textures can be added to the nebula\default folder to
display many additional textures kindly authorised for use in Stellarium by many people.

They include textures by Albert Van Donklaar, Phillip Montgomery, Steve Tuttle, 
Trevor Gerdes, Jason Jennings, Marc Aragnou and others whose names I may have 
missed but will be listed in the textures.json file

The large textures lmc, Eta-carina and ic4604 have been split into a mosaic of 4 textures.
This allows more precise location.

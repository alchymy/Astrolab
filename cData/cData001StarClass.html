In the Yerkes classification 
scheme, stars are assigned to groups according to the width of their spectral 
lines. For a group of stars with the same temperature, the luminosity class 
differentiates between their sizes (supergiants, giants, main-sequence stars, 
and subdwarfs). <br />

  <h1>Classification History</h1>

<p> In 1802, William Wollaston noted that the spectrum of sunlight did not 
  appear to be a continuous band of colours, but rather had a series 
  of dark lines superimposed on it. Wollaston attributed the lines to 
  natural boundaries between colours. Joseph Fraunhofer made a more 
  careful set of observations of the solar spectrum in 1814 and found 
  some 600 dark lines, and he specifically measured the wavelength of 324 
  of them. Many of the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum retain the 
  notations he created to designate them. In 1864, Sir William Huggins 
  matched some of these dark lines in spectra from other stars with 
  terrestrial substances, demonstrating that stars are made of the same
  materials of everyday material rather than exotic substances.  This paved
  the way for modern spectroscopy.
<p> Since even before the discovery of spectra, scientists had tried to find 
  ways to categorize stars.  By observing spectra, astronomers realized that large 
  numbers of stars exhibit a small number of distinct patterns in their spectral 
  lines.  Classification by spectral features quickly proved to be a powerful tool 
  for understanding stars.
<p> The current spectral classification scheme was developed at 
  Harvard Observatory in the early 20th century.  Work was begun by Henry 
  Draper who photographed the first spectrum of Vega in 1872. After his 
  death, his wife donated the equipment and a sum of money to the 
  Observatory to continue his work. The bulk of the classification work 
  was done by Annie Jump Cannon from 1918 to 1924. The original scheme 
  used capital letters running alphabetically, but subsequent revisions 
  have reduced this as stellar evolution and typing has become better 
  understood. The work was published in the Henry Draper Catalogue (HD)
  and Henry Draper Extension (HDE) which contained spectra of 225,000 stars 
  down to ninth magnitude.
<p> The scheme is based on lines which are mainly sensitive to stellar 
  surface temperatures rather than actual compositional differences, 
  gravity, or luminosity. Important lines are the hydrogen Balmer lines, 
  lines of neutral and singly ionized helium, iron lines, the H and K 
  doublet of ionized calcium at 396.8 and 393.3 nm, the G band due to the 
  CH molecule, the 422.7 nm neutral calcium line, several metal lines 
  around 431 nm, and the lines of titanium oxide.</p>

<h2>Standard Stellar Types (O, B, A, F, G, K, and M)</h2>
While the differences in spectra might seem to indicate different 
chemical compositions, in almost all instances, it actually reflects 
different surface temperatures. With some exceptions (e.g. the R, N, 
and S stellar types discussed below), material on the surface of stars 
is &quot;primitive&quot;: there is no significant chemical or nuclear 
processing of the gaseous outer envelope of a star once it has formed. 
Fusion at the core of the star results in fundamental compositional 
changes, but material does not generally mix between the visible 
surface of the star and its core.
<p> Ordered from highest temperature to lowest, the seven main stellar 
  types are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Astronomers use <A HREF="obafgkmrns.html">one of several mnemonics </A>to remember the 
  order of the classification scheme. O, B, and A type stars are often 
  referred to as <i>early</i> spectral types, while cool stars (G, K, and 
  M) are known as <i>late</i> type stars. The nomenclature is rooted in 
  long-obsolete ideas about stellar evolution, but the terminology 
  remains. The spectral characteristics of these types are summarized 
  below:
<center>
</center>
<h3>Subtypes</h3>
Within each of these seven broad categories, Canon assigned subclasses 
numbered 0 to 9. A star midway through the range between F0 and G0 
would be an F5 type star. The Sun is a G2 type star.
<p>
<h3>Luminosity classes</h3>
The Harvard scheme specifies only the surface temperature and some spectral
features of the star.  A more precise classification would also include the 
luminosity of the star.  The standard scheme used for this is called the 
Yerkes classification (or MMK, based on the initials of the authors 
William W. Morgan, Philip C. Keenan, and Edith Kellman).  This scheme measures 
the shape and nature of certain spectral lines to measure surface gravities
of stars.  The gravitational acceleration on the surface of a giant star is
much lower than for a dwarf star (since g = G M / R<SUP>2</SUP> and the radius
of a giant star is much larger than a dwarf).  Given the lower gravity, 
gas pressures and densities are much lower in giant stars than in dwarfs.
These differences manifest themselves in different spectral line shapes 
which can be measured.
<p> The Yerkes scheme uses the six luminosity classes shown on the first tab, so the Sun would be more fully specified as a G2V type star.
<p>
<h3>Additional categorization nomenclature</h3>
Spectra can reveal many other things about stars. Accordingly, lowercase 
letters are sometimes added to the end of a spectral type to indicate 
peculiarities.

<p>
<h2>Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars (R, N, and S)</h2>
After exhausting the hydrogen supply in its core, nuclear fusion of 
hydrogen to helium will continue in a shell surrounding the core.  The core 
will essentially be a hot degenerate helium star (or helium white 
dwarf) encased in a hydrogen burning shell. Grossly simplifying the 
process, helium produced in the shell around the inert core will add to 
the core's mass until degenerate pressure heats the core sufficiently 
to start helium fusion within the core.  Helium fusion will then continue in the 
core until once again, the core fuel supply is exhausted and the star has an 
inert hot carbon-oxygen white dwarf core surrounded by an inner shell of helium 
fusion and an outer shell of hydrogen fusion.  This double-shell burning phase 
is known as the <B>asymptotic giant branch</B> stage, a name based on how stellar 
evolution proceeds when charted on a Hertzprung-Russell diagram.
<p> Stars in the asymptotic giant branch are short-lived.  The degenerate core
  of the star is more massive that it was in the single-shell burning phase, and
  due to the peculiar nature of degenerate matter, the more massive core is 
  physically smaller.  The gravity experienced by overlying layers is hence 
  stronger, requiring higher luminosities to maintain the balance between 
  pressure and gravity.  Thus the star expends energy at a very high rate and 
  may well become a <B>red supergiant</B>.
  
  Stars in this phase of stellar evolution have proven to be challenging to
  model.  One problem is that the helium shell burning is not stable.  The layer
  of helium fusion is thin.  Slight positive perturbations in the nuclear energy 
  generate extra pressure and the region is enlarged slightly.  But because the
  layer is thin, the change in height is slight and hence the change in pressure
  on the hotter region is changed very little.  The higher temperature will
  likely increase the rate of nuclear reactions (many reactions processes are 
  very temperature sensitive, such as the triple-alpha process which will most
  likely be dominate in the helium shell).  Thus local reaction rates will pick
  up, generating more heat before it can diffuse.  Thus large runaway reaction
  spots can start from small local condition changes.  The runaway is only
  checked after considerable expansion and the creation of a convective cycle
  to carry away the excess energy.  Yet even once the runaway is checked and 
  the layer resettles, the same underlying physical problem remains.  There is
  no real stable helium shell burning mode.  Thus the star will experience spasms
  of energy generation with convective cells which may carry material all the
  way up to the hydrogen burning shell, followed by longer periods of relaxation
  back to the thin shell.
<p> If the convective cells created during this helium fusion runaways reach
  all the way to the hydrogen fusion layer, this would potentially provide a 
  mechanism for material deep within the star to be dredged up to its surface.
  This may nicely explain several stellar types which seem analogous with K and
  M stars temperature-wise, but show some other spectral features as if their
  outer atmospheres had been enriched with heavier element.  These types are the
  R, N, and S types.
<h3>R and N type stars</h3>
A number of giant stars appear to be K or M type stars, but also show 
significant excess spectral features of carbon compounds.  They are often 
referred to as &quot;carbon stars&quot; and many astronomers collectively refer 
to them as C type stars.  The most common spectral features are from 
C<SUB>2</SUB>, CN, and CH.  The abundance of carbon to oxygen in these stars
is four to five times higher than in normal stars.  The presence of these
carbon compounds will tend to absorb the blue portion of the spectrum,
giving R and N type giants a distinctive red colour.  R stars are those with 
hotter surfaces which otherwise more closely resemble K type stars.  S type stars
have cooler surfaces and more closely resemble M stars.
<p>
<h3>S type stars</h3>
S type stars have photospheres with enhanced abundances of <i>s</i>-process 
elements.  These are isotopes of elements which have been formed from the 
capture of a free neutron (changing the isotope of the element) followed by a 
beta decay (a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, thus changing the 
element to one with a higher atomic number and an isotope with one less 
neutron).  The <i>s</i>-process is one of the mechanisms by which elements with 
atomic numbers higher than 56 (Iron) can be made.  The <i>s</i> stands for slow.
By way of contrast, its partner <i>r</i>-process (for rapid) takes place when 
there are a sufficient supply of free neutrons for additional neutrons to be 
acquired in the atomic nucleus before the captured neutron has a chance to 
beta decay.
<p> Instead of (or in addition to) the usual lines of titanium, scandium, and 
  vanadium oxides characteristic of M type giants, S type stars show heavier 
  elements such as zirconium, yttrium, and barium.  A significant fraction of all 
  S type stars are variable.
<p>
<h2>Peculiar Stars</h2>
<h3>Wolf-Rayet Stars (WR)</h3>
Wolf-Rayet stars are similar to O type stars, but have broad emission
lines of hydrogen and ionized helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen with very
few absorption lines.  Current theory holds that these stars exist in binary
systems where the companion star has stripped away the Wolf-Rayet star's 
outer layers.  Thus the spectra observed is from the exposed stellar interior
rather than the normal surface material.  The broadness of the lines also
indicates that the material observed may be from high velocity gases streaming
away from the star, with the range of velocities smearing out the observed
lines.
<p>
<h3>T Tauri Stars (T)</h3>
T Tauri stars are very young stars, typically found in bright or dark
interstellar clouds from which they have presumably just formed.  Typically
T Tauri stars are irregular variable stars, with unpredictable changes in
their brightness.  Their spectra contains bright emission lines and a number
of &quot;forbidden lines&quot; (so-called because they are not observable in
typical laboratory conditions) which indicate extremely low densities.  Spectral
lines also show Doppler shifts with respect to the rest velocity of the star,
indicating that matter is streaming out from them.

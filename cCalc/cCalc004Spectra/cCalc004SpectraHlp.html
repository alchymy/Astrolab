ID vs. Name in Form Fields
When creating a form and form field, you should give them both an id and a name and make them the same, e.g. 

<form id="form1" name="form1">
<input type="text" id="form1Field1" name="form1Field1" />
<input type="text" id="form1Field2" name="form1Field2" />
</form>

This is because browsers use the name field when they submit to a server, but when working with JavaScript it's best to use id (and the associated document.getElementById()) to identify elements. You could use something like document.getElementsByName(), but it is a lot harder to work with, because names aren't guaranteed to be unique and thus that function returns a collection of elements, not just one. 
You should also always name your name and id the same thing (and not reuse that identifier anywhere else), 
because of IE's poor implementation of getElementById() which can sometimes return an element whose "name" matches the "id"
you asked for. 

Always use both, make them the same string, and make that string unique in the document. 
XHTML spec [1] says that name is deprecated for id, and that eventually name will go away completely.  
The spec also recommends using both the name and the id attributes, set identically, for forwards and backwards compatibility.

<p/>
If you want to use the applet on one of your web pages, here
are some helpful information:<p/>
<p/>
The element, wavelength range and line width are all
controlled by applet parameter (PARAM) tags in the HTML source for this page.
There are other options such as width and height of spectra in pixels and
contrast which can also be controlled. There are also
options to overlay a continuous spectrum
of varying strength and to choose the wavelength range. But note that
the data sets I use here contain only lines in the 4000 to 7000
&Aring; range<br />
For example here are the parameters for Neon :<p/>
<pre>
&lt;APPLET CODE=discharge.class WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=version VALUE=0&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=eye VALUE=0&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=element VALUE=neon.txt&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=startWavelength VALUE=4000&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=endWavelength VALUE=7000&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=lineWidth VALUE=2.5&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=contrast VALUE=10&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=continuum VALUE=0.3&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
</pre>


<ul>
<li><b>Version</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Value = 0: show only the spectrum of the element  </li>
  <li>Value = 1: the full applet with the controls tha permit the 
                 user to change any parameter  </li>
  <li>Value = 2: show only the spectrum of the element, but without
                 the wavelength scale  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Eye</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Value = 0: this is how a young person with normal vision perceives
       the spectral colours  </li>
  <li>Value = 1: this is how I - at an age of 59 - perceive the colours. Note
       that I can no longer look much more blueward than 
       H<font face="Symbol">g</font>...  </li>
  <li>Value = 2: this is how a person with yellow-green colour blindness
       perceives the colours. I had asked a student to describe at which
       wavelengths he perceives different colours, when looking at white
       sunlight through a spectroscope.   </li>
  <li>Value = 3: just a black and white view, as if we could see well
      at all wavelengths  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

The simulated gas discharge spectrum is synthesized by assuming that each
each emission line has a gaussian line profile. Each point in the spectrum
is computed as the sum of all the emission lines.
<ul>
<li><b>Contrast</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Range: 1 to 10000  (the upper limit comes from intensity of the weakest line)  </li>
  <li>Default: 1  (maximum of strongest line assigned to maximum intensity, no
                   distortion of line profile)  </li>
  <li>Increase this parameter to bring up the weaker lines. Of course, 
one burns out the strongest lines and also the relative difference between 
the various emission line strengths is lost. Find a compromise to get a 
pleasing impression -- this applet was not designed to allow accurate 
intensity measurements.  </li>
  </ul>

</li>
<li><b>Line Width</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Range: 0 to 100  </li>
  <li>Default: 3</li>
  <li>The width of emission lines can be set by the user
so that the line profile covers at least one pixel: too small a width 
causes undersampling to occur and some lines may disappear! 
However too broad a line will cause blending of lines that are closer 
together. Again, a compromise must be reached.  </li>
  </ul>

</li>
<li><b>Continuum</b>: 
  <ul>
  <li>Range: 0 to 1  </li>
  <li>Default: 0.3  </li>
  <li>Physics: Apart from the line emission, there often is also
a broadband background light, for instance by scattering from 
an external white source or internal transitions involving the 
ion continuum. This causes a smooth background to appear as 
faint 'rainbow'. Here, we merely use it as a pleasing coloured 
background to fill in the dark gaps between the lines.  </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Physics Background</h2>

There are two basic line broadening mechanisms; instrumental and intrinsic :
<ul>
<li><b>Instrumental Broadening</b>
  <ul>
  <li>The first is due to finite spectroscopic resolution and can
be controlled by the researcher. Often higher resolution can be
achieved by larger gratings or coarse gratings operated in higher order
or longer path lengths for fourier transform spectrometers.  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Intrinsic Broadening</b>
  <ul>
  <li>The second is fundamental line broadening
      which can be caused by at least three factors:
  <ol>
  <li>Doppler Broadening
    <ul>
    <li>Related to special relativity: Motion components
of a particle along the line of sight causes a shift in
radiation frequency. Since particles generally have a distribution
of velocities, this creates a gaussian blurring in the spectral lines.    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lifetime Broadening
  <ul>
  <li>Quantum mechanical in origin : 
Allowed transitions have a short lifetime and this
translates to some uncertainty in the frequency of atomic
oscillators creating a Lorentzian line profile.  </li>
  </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Density Broadening
    <ul>
    <li>Combination of quantum mechanical and electromagnetic effects: 
Ions are bombarded by transient electric and magnetic fields
of high speed electrons zipping nearby, these electric fields
split and shift the energy levels. This constant perturbation within
the plasma environment depends most strongly on density and causes
strong line broadening in higher density plasmas. Temperature,
ionization level and the particular quantum transition involved
also plays a role.    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

In most thin plasmas one sees a combination of Doppler and
Lorenztian broadening called Voigt profiles. The Lorentzian component
affects mostly the low intensity 'wings' of the emission lines
so line profiles can be approximated as gaussians, especially
considering the dynamic range limitations of computer screens.
Most of the time spectra taken by researchers do not fully
resolve the intrinsic line profile so the lines are broadened
mainly by instrumental imperfection.<p>&nbsp;

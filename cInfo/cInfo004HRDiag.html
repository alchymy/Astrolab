            The HR diagram can be used to display many facets of stellar astronomy:<br>
            <br/>
    1. It can show the association between the intrinsic properties of temperature and luminosity.<br/>
    2. It allows us to derive masses, lifetimes and evolutionary phases.<br/>
    3. It allows us to study the properties of stellar clusters (e.g. galactic 
    and globular clusters).<br/>
        The figure shows a schematic HR diagram. The HR diagram is a plot of stellar brightness against stellar temperature or colour.<br/>
    <br/>
    However, there are other related diagrams which are more suitable for observational astronomy and the name HR diagram is sometimes used as a 
    generic title for a family of related plots including:  <br>
    <br/>
    1. Colour-magnitude diagram<br/>
    2. Colour-colour diagram<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The theoretical HR diagram is a plot of luminosity against effective temperature. The observational HR diagram is plot of absolute magnitude 
    against either colour index or spectral type.

      A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram example is a plot of luminosity (absolute magnitude) 
      against the colour of the stars ranging from the high-temperature blue-white stars on the left side of the diagram to the 
      low temperature red stars on the right side. <br/>
      <p>This diagram shown is a plot of 22000 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue 
        together with 1000 low-luminosity stars (red and white dwarfs) from the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The 
        ordinary hydrogen-burning dwarf stars like the Sun are found in a band running from top-left to bottom-right called the Main 
        Sequence. Giant stars form their own clump on the upper-right side of the diagram. Above them lie the much rarer bright 
        giants and supergiants. At the lower-left is the band of white dwarfs - 
        these are the dead cores of old stars which have no internal energy source 
        and over billions of years slowly cool down towards the bottom-right of the 
        diagram.&quot;<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was introduced around 1918 and was the 
        result of work on the classification of stars, mainly following from studies of 
        their spectral features in the optical spectrum. Two astronomers independently 
        found that when luminosity was plotted against stellar temperature a particular 
        pattern emerged. The two astronomers were called Hertzsprung and Russell and we now call the diagram the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or HR diagram. This is 
        probably the single most important diagram in common use within astrophysics.<br/>

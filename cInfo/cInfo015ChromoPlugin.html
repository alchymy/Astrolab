<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>Gamma-Ray (<a 
href="http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Fermi All Sky Survey</a>) </strong></p>
<p>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly GLAST, reveals the high-energy 
sky between 10 keV – 300 GeV. With Fermi, astronomers can study black holes and 
other highly energetic events in the universe. Physicists can use Fermi to study 
subatomic particles at energies far greater than those seen in ground-based 
particle accelerators. And cosmologists gain valuable information about the 
birth and early evolution of the Universe.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>X-Ray (ROSAT 
All Sky Survey)</strong></p>
  <p>The Roentgensatellit (ROSAT) was a joint German, US and British X-ray 
astrophysics project. ROSAT carried a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) 
with three focal plane instruments that allowed researchers to probe high-energy 
x-ray activity in the universe between 0.1 to 2 keV. ROSAT also performed an all 
sky survey in revealing the structure of our galaxy in this energetic wavelength 
regime.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>The Visual Sky (DSS / 
  Wikisky)</strong></p>
<p>The Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) comprises a set of all-sky photographic 
surveys in E, V, J, R, and N bands conducted with the Palomar and UK Schmidt 
telescopes. The photographic survey has been digitized to support the Hubble 
Space Telescope observing programs but also as a service to the astronomical 
community.</p>
  <p>The particular blend of the DSS used for the Chromoscope comes from Wikisky, 
a similar tool that allows you to explore individual objects in the night sky 
and learn a little more about them.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>H-Alpha (WHAM 
/ SHASSA / 
  VTSS / 
  Finkbeiner)</strong></p>
<p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and there is plenty of 
it in our own Milky Way galaxy. H-alpha refers to a specific energy emitted by 
hydrogen atoms and seen as red light with a wavelength of 656.3 nanometres. The 
h-alpha part of the Chromoscope comes from several source including WHAM, The 
Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper, and SHASSA the Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas. WHAM 
is funded by the American National Science Foundation.</p>
  <p>H-alpha allows us to see features on the surface of the Sun as well as 
tracing out the location of hydrogen gas in our galaxy.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>Far Infrared (IRAS)</strong></p>
<p>The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) was a joint project of the US, UK 
and the Netherlands. The IRAS mission performed an unbiased, sensitive all sky 
survey at 12, 25, 60 and 100 µm.&nbsp;IRAS increased the number of cataloged 
astronomical sources by about 70%, detecting about 350,000 infrared sources.</p>
  <p>IRAS discoveries included a disk of dust grains around the star Vega, six new 
comets, and very strong infrared emission from interacting galaxies as well as 
wisps of warm dust called infrared cirrus which could be found in almost every 
direction of space. IRAS also revealed for the first time the core of our 
galaxy, the Milky Way.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>Microwave (Planck)</strong></p>
  <p>The Planck satellite is an ESA mission that launched May 2009 to make 
fundamental measurements of cosmology – the study of the properties of our 
universe as a whole. Planck has been stunningly successful, building on the 
success of the WMAP mission, and has completed one full sky survey. It has 
mapped the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation – the oldest light in the 
universe – and produced a detailed, full-sky map, using data from nine microwave 
wavelength bands ranging from 10mm to 0.35mm.&nbsp; As well as seeing the oldest 
light in the Universe, it also sees gas and dust within our own Galaxy.<br />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>Radio (Haslam)</strong></p>
<p>408MHz, a relatively low radio frequency, allows us to measure radiation 
produced by electrons travelling close to the speed of light and spiralling in 
magnetic fields. The full-sky map of Haslam et al. (1981-1982), combining data 
from 3 large (60-100m) radio telescopes around the world, shows strong emission 
from the disk of our galaxy. Away from the disk, large features are also seen, 
which are thought to be remnants of nearby ancient supernova. The map is also 
dotted with distant radio galaxies.</p></DIV></DIV>

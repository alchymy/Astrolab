          <p>ABSTRACT:</p>
          <p>The scientific method is the process by which scientists, 
            collectively and over time, endeavour to construct a reliable, consistent and 
            non-arbitrary, explanation of observed phenomena while minimising bias or 
            prejudice from the experimenter when developing and testing an hypothesis or a 
        theory. The notes below summarise the four steps in the method from observation to possible explanation of observations to prediction and testing of proposed explanation of observations.</p></td>

<h3><a id="Heading3">I. The scientific method has four steps</a></h3>
<p>1. Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of 
phenomena. 
</p>
<p>2. Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena. 
This can take the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation.</p>
<p>3. Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other 
phenomena, or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations. 
</p>
<p>4. Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by 
several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.
</p>
<p>If the experimental results support the hypothesis it may 
come to be regarded as a theory or &quot;law of nature&quot;. If the results of 
experiments do not support the hypothesis, it must be rejected or modified. The 
key in the description of the scientific method above is the predictive power of 
the hypothesis or theory, as tested by experiment. There is always the 
possibility that a new observation or a new experiment will conflict with a 
supported long-standing theory. 
</p>
<h3><a id="Heading4">II. Testing hypotheses</a></h3>
<p>Experiments may lead either to the confirmation of the 
hypothesis, or to the ruling out of the hypothesis. The scientific method 
requires that an hypothesis be ruled out or modified if its predictions are 
clearly and repeatedly incompatible with experimental tests. Further, no matter 
how elegant a theory is, its predictions must agree with experimental results if 
we are to believe that it is a valid description of nature.&nbsp; Experiments 
may test the theory directly (for example, the observation of a new particle) or 
may test for consequences derived from the theory using mathematics and logic 
(the rate of a radioactive decay process requiring the existence of the new 
particle). Note that the necessity of experiment also implies that a theory must 
be testable. Theories which cannot be tested, because, for instance, they have 
no observable ramifications (such as, a particle whose characteristics make it 
unobservable), do not qualify as scientific theories.</p>
<p>If the predictions of a long-standing theory are found to 
be in disagreement with new experimental results, the theory may be discarded as 
a description of reality, but it may continue to be applicable within a limited 
range of measurable parameters. For example, the laws of classical mechanics 
(Newton&#39;s Laws) are valid only when the velocities of interest are much smaller 
than the speed of light (that is, in algebraic form, when v/c &lt;&lt; 1). Since this 
is the domain of a large portion of human experience, the laws of classical 
mechanics are widely, usefully and correctly applied in a large range of 
technological and scientific problems. Yet in nature we observe a domain in 
which v/c is not small. The motions of objects in this domain, as well as motion 
in the &quot;classical&quot; domain, are accurately described through the equations of 
Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. We believe, due to experimental tests, that 
relativistic theory provides a more general, and therefore more accurate, 
description of the principles governing our universe, than the earlier 
&quot;classical&quot; theory. Further, we find that the relativistic equations reduce to 
the classical equations in the limit v/c &lt;&lt; 1. Similarly, classical physics is 
valid only at distances much larger than atomic scales (x &gt;&gt; 10<sup>-8 </sup>m). 
A description which is valid at all length scales is given by the equations of 
quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>We are all familiar with theories which had to be 
discarded in the face of experimental evidence. In the field of astronomy, the 
earth-centered description of the planetary orbits was overthrown by the 
Copernican system, in which the sun was placed at the center of a series of 
concentric, circular planetary orbits. Later, this theory was modified, as 
measurements of the planets motions were found to be compatible with elliptical, 
not circular, orbits, and still later planetary motion was found to be derivable 
from Newton&#39;s laws. </p>
<p>Error in experiments have several sources. First, there is 
error intrinsic to instruments of measurement. Because this type of error has 
equal probability of producing a measurement higher or lower numerically than 
the &quot;true&quot; value, it is called random error. Second, there is non-random or 
systematic error, due to factors which bias the result in one direction. No 
measurement, and therefore no experiment, can be perfectly precise. At the same 
time, in science we have standard ways of estimating and in some cases reducing 
errors. Thus it is important to determine the accuracy of a particular 
measurement and, when stating quantitative results, to quote the measurement 
error. A measurement without a quoted error is meaningless. The comparison 
between experiment and theory is made within the context of experimental errors. 
Scientists ask, how many standard deviations are the results from the 
theoretical prediction? Have all sources of systematic and random errors been 
properly estimated?</p>
<h3>
<a id="Heading5">III. Common Mistakes in Applying the 
Scientific Method</a></h3>
<p>As stated earlier, the scientific method attempts to 
minimize the influence of the scientist&#39;s bias on the outcome of an experiment. 
That is, when testing an hypothesis or a theory, the scientist may have a 
preference for one outcome or another, and it is important that this preference 
not bias the results or their interpretation. The most fundamental error is to 
mistake the hypothesis for an explanation of a phenomenon, without performing 
experimental tests.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is to 
ignore or rule out data which do not support the hypothesis. Ideally, the 
experimenter is open to the possibility that the hypothesis is correct or 
incorrect. The lesson is that all data must be handled in the same way.
</p>
<p>Another common mistake arises from the failure to <u>
estimate</u> 
<u>quantitatively </u>systematic errors (and all errors). There are many 
examples of discoveries which were missed by experimenters whose data contained 
a new phenomenon, but who explained it away as a systematic background. 
Conversely, there are many examples of alleged &quot;new discoveries&quot; which later 
proved to be due to systematic errors not accounted for by the &quot;discoverers.&quot;
</p>
<h3><a id="Heading6">IV. Hypotheses, Models, Theories and 
Laws</a></h3>
<p>The words &quot;hypothesis,&quot; &quot;model,&quot; &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;law&quot; have 
different connotations in relation to the stage of acceptance or knowledge about 
a group of phenomena.
</p>
<p>1) <u>hypothesis</u> is a limited statement regarding 
cause and effect in specific situations; it also refers to our state of 
knowledge before experimental work has been performed and perhaps even before 
new phenomena have been predicted. To take an example from daily life, suppose 
you discover that your car will not start. You may say, &quot;My car does not start 
because the battery is low.&quot; This is your first hypothesis. You may then check 
whether the lights were left on, or if the engine makes a particular sound when 
you turn the ignition key. You might actually check the voltage across the 
terminals of the battery. If you discover that the battery is not low, you might 
attempt another hypothesis (&quot;The starter is broken&quot;) </p>
<p>2) <u>model</u> is reserved for situations when it is 
known that the hypothesis has at least limited validity. An example of this is 
the Bohr model of the atom, in which, in an analogy to the solar system, the 
electrons are described has moving in circular orbits around the nucleus. This 
is not an accurate depiction of what an atom &quot;looks like,&quot; but the model 
succeeds in mathematically representing the energies (but not the correct 
angular momenta) of the quantum states of the electron in the simplest case, the 
hydrogen atom. </p>
<p>3) a <u>scientific theory</u> or law represents an 
hypothesis, or a group of related hypotheses, which has been confirmed through 
repeated experimental tests. Accepted scientific theories and laws become part 
of our understanding of the universe and the basis for exploring other areas of 
knowledge. Theories are not easily discarded; new discoveries are first assumed 
to fit into the existing theoretical framework. It is only when, after repeated 
experimental tests, the new phenomenon cannot be accommodated that scientists 
seriously question the theory and attempt to modify it.</p>
